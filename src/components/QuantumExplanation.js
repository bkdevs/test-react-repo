          Imagine you have two pairs of magical socks. When you put one sock in 
          New York and another in Tokyo, whatever happens to one sock instantly 
          affects the other sock, no matter how far apart they are!
        </p>
        <p>
          That's similar to quantum entanglement - when two particles become 
          "entangled," they share a special connection. When you measure one 
          particle, you instantly know what the other particle is doing, even if 
          it's on the opposite side of the universe.
        </p>
        <p>
          Scientists use this weird connection in quantum computers and secure 
          communication systems. It's like having two particles that are always 
          in sync, no matter where they are!
